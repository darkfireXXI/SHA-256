# SHA-256
Building SHA-256 hashing algorithm from scratch

## The Short Cut
Fortunately, you don't have to do this as you can import hashlib and in two lines do all the work:  
text = input()  
digest = hashlib.sha256(('text').encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()

## The Long Cut
Write it from scratch for fun! See Hashing.py

## Choose Function Error
A quick run of the file reveals the script does not hash correnctly. Using [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbekM2ErHfM) as a reference 

Run the jupyter notebook to see all the techniques.
